## Project Summary

Project developed with L√≠lia Correia and Marta Casal, under the Postgraduate Diploma in Digital Experience Design, which consisted in designing an interactive or semi-functional prototype of a digital product or service, following a user-centered approach.

We designed PayUp; a mobile app to manage shared expenses, receive and pay debts, without the need to expose banking information. All you need is a mobile phone number.

To tackle this challenge we mapped out the following strategy:

* Ideation and Problem Definition
  * Elevator Pitch
  * Business Model Canvas
  * Value Proposition Canvas
* Research and Strategy
  * Bibliographical Research
  * Technical Documentation Analysis
  * Benchmarking
  * Online Surveys
  * Interviews with Users
  * Expert Interview
  * Personas
  * User and Job Stories
* Interaction Design
  * Functional Requirements Analysis
  * Information Architecture
  * Content Strategy
  * Wireflows
  * User Feedback Rounds üîÅ
* Visual Design
  * Branding
  * Mockups
  * User Feedback Rounds üîÅ
* Prototyping
  * Product Requirements Document
  * Prototype (MVP)
* Presentation
  * Pitch Deck and Live Demo
  * Project Report

Even though all team members were involved in all project phases, we each chose a main user flow to work on. I was responsible for designing the flow to create a group to share expenses and add an expense to that group.

**Create a Group and Add an Expense User Flows:**

* Bot Walk Through version (conversational)
* Power User version (chatbot)

L√≠lia tackled the flow for creating an account for a new user and Marta worked on sending money to a friend (making a payment).
