## Project Summary

Project developed with L√≠lia Correia and Marta Casal, under the Postgraduate Diploma in Digital Experience Design, which consisted in designing an interactive or semi-functional prototype of a digital product or service, following a user-centered approach.

We designed PayUp; a mobile app to manage shared expenses, receive and pay debts, without the need to expose banking information. All you need is a mobile phone number.

To tackle this challenge we mapped out the following strategy:

+ Ideation and Problem Definition
  - Elevator Pitch
  - Business Model Canvas
  - Value Proposition Canvas
- Research and Strategy
  - Bibliographical Research
  - Technical Documentation Analysis
  - Benchmarking
  - Online Surveys
  - Interviews (with potential users)
  - Expert Interview
  - Personas
  - User and Job Stories
- Interaction Design
  - Functional Requirements Analysis
  - Information Architecture
  - Content Strategy
  - Wireflows
  - User Feedback Rounds üîÅ
- Visual Design

  - Product Requirements Document
  - Prototype (MVP)
  - User Feedback Rounds üîÅ
- Presentation
  - Pitch Deck and Live Demo
  - Project Report

Even though all team members were involved in all project phases, we each chose a main user flow to work on. I was responsible for designing the flow to create a group to share expenses and add an expense to that group.

## Context and Challenge (Ideation)

With the increasing digitalization of our society, consumers‚Äô habits and expectations have been rapidly changing. The trend of instant access to goods and services, mainly through mobile phones, has driven the growth of real-time payments, fast (instant) and simple.

> Customers make increasingly use of these online and mobile channels to buy goods and services at anytime and anywhere. These developments contribute to the expectation for a faster (or real-time) finality and/or confirmation of the payment. (EPC Report to the ERPB ‚Äì Euro Retail Payments Board ‚Äì on Instant Payments)

PayUp is a mobile app that allows people to split and keep track of shared expenses, pay and collect debts among friends, easily, swiftly and safely, without the need to expose banking information.

PayUp is readily available, anywhere, all the time, to quickly and effortlessly manage splitting costs without estimates, avoid lack of change, having the right amount, or having to know the recipient‚Äôs banking data to make a payment. All that is needed is a mobile phone number or an email address.

The entry into force in 2018 of the new European Payment Services Directive (PSD2) creates the ideal operating conditions for the development of a product like PayUp, operated by a non-banking Fintech (PISP ‚Äî Payment Initiation Service Provider).

By promoting the entry of new players in the business, simplifying the processing of digital payments in the European Union, improving its efficiency, reducing the costs of digital payments, forcing banks to make open APIs available and increasing the security of payments with strong customer authentication (2-factor authentication), PSD2 enables this type of system.

## Methodology

We followed a LEAN methodology throughout this project. Our primary focus was always, first and foremost, on the perception of our potential users‚Äô needs, testing the solutions that emerged and constantly iterating to improve the previously encountered solutions‚Äô hypothesis... Iterate until Awesome!

Whenever possible, everything was tested with real users; mostly colleagues, trainers and friends. Their feedback was essential to the evolution of the design.

<br></br>

The development of the project went through 3 major phases:

__1. Research and Strategy__

We wanted to make sure that splitting and managing shared expenses, as well as collecting/sending payments, were real problems of our presumed target audience. We tried to find data that could enlighten us on the business area we were working on and help shape the features and requirements that were necessary for the adoption of our solution.

  * Bibliographical Research
  * Technical Documentation Analysis
  * Benchmarking
  * Online Surveys
  * Interviews (with potential users)
  * Expert Interview
  * Personas
  * User and Job Stories

__2. Interaction Design__

We defined the user flows of the different personas, the information architecture and the wireframes of the platforms that make up our product (mobile app and landing page).

  * Functional Requirements Analysis
  * Information Architecture
  * Content Strategy
  * Wireflows
  * User Feedback Rounds üîÅ

__3. Visual Design and Prototyping__

We designed all visual aspects concerning the product, from branding to high-fidelity mockups and prototypes.

  * Branding
  * Mockups
  * User Feedback Rounds üîÅ
  * Product Requirements Document
  * Prototypes (MVP)
  * User Feedback Rounds üîÅ

## Research and Strategy

Our research plan was kickstarted by five central questions:

1. What are the most important technical and legal requirements and constraints when developing an instant payment/transfer service?

2. Who are our competitors? What are the market trends?

3. How does our target audience split expenses?

4. Which factors influence them the most when choosing a payment/transfer service?

5. Which pain points are they facing and how can we fix them?

Answering these questions was pivotal to assure we were building a true user centric product that would effectively solve a real problem.

To answer our research questions we used the following research methods:
<br></br>

| #       | Research Questions | Research Methods |
| :-----: | --------- | ---------------- |
| **1** | What are the most important technical and legal requirements and constraints when developing an instant payment/transfer service? | - Bibliographical research;<br/>Technical documentation analysis (Directives, Rulebooks, Regulations);<br/>- Interviews with banking experts. |
| **2** | Who are our competitors? What are the market trends? | - Analysis on previous sector reports / Market research (Ex: SIBS Market Report 2016);<br/>- Benchmarking (researching our direct and indirect competitors in order to analyze its‚Äô strengths, weaknesses and possible improvements). |   
| **3** | How does our target audience split expenses? | - Online surveys;<br/> - Interviews with target users. |

### Documentary Research and Analysis

Researching and studying the documentation on instant payments and the PSD2 European Directive was of utterly importance, as we weren‚Äôt very familiar with all the norms, requirements and constraints that rule electronic payments in the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA).

You can [download our bibliography here]( https://github.com/FilipaGo/payup-app-prototype/raw/master/_docs_readme/payup_bibliography.pdf  "PayUp‚Äôs Bibliography") if you want to read some of the documents we studied but... Friendly reminder üò¨ ‚Ä¶ If I were you, I‚Äôd stick with just scanning through our findings üí§

The new European Payment Services Directive (PSD2), which becomes applicable on January 13th 2018, is what enables the rising of a product like PayUp.

<br></br>
<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FilipaGo/payup-app-prototype/master/_images_readme/psd2.jpg" width="1000" />
</p>
<br></br>

All EU banks are obliged to comply with this directive by September 2019, and make open APIs available to any Payment Initiation Service Provider (PISP) ‚Äî that‚Äôs us! üí™

> At the core of PSD2 is the need for Banks (= Account Servicing Payment Service Providers or AS PSPs) to grant AISP and PISP (= Third Party Providers or TPPs) access to their online account/payment services (...)
This includes an ‚ÄúAccess to Accounts‚Äù (XS2A) rule, which will force Banks/ PSPs to facilitate secure access through API to their customer accounts and provide account information to third party apps, if the account holder wishes to do so. (PSD2, Open API and Real-time Breakthrough in Payments: the Retailers‚Äô Perspective)

A PISP is a Service Provider that initiates a payment order (transfer), at the request of the user, relative to an account that is held by another Payment Services Provider (like a bank or SIBS, in Portugal).

Being a PISP, we must comply with a set of obligations:

* We may not, at any time, hold the payer's funds;
* We must ensure that the user's custom security credentials are not accessible by other
parts;
* We cannot change the amount, the payer or any other element of the transaction.

Analyzing the documentation led us to quite a few findings that would have implications in the development of our product:

#### Security and Authentication

* Electronic payments/transfers are now subject to strong customer authentication (2-factor authentication). As such, the users‚Äô identity must be verified with 2 personalized credentials.

* Transfers of less than ‚Ç¨ 30 and whose cumulative amount of transactions since the last transaction that was made with strong authentication does not exceed 100 to 500 euros (depending on the level of fraud observed in the Payments Service Provider ‚Äî PSP) do not require the strong authentication mechanism.

* Strong authentication is mandatory except for low value transactions (< ‚Ç¨ 30) or when transferring money to pre-parameterized beneficiaries.

#### Costs

If there are any, the national transfer fees are settled by the payer, however the SEPA CT scheme allows that fees may be shared between the payer and the beneficiary.

Just to make it perfectly clear... the payer is the person who sends the money and the beneficiary is the one who receives it. ü§ì

#### Mandatory Data

**The following data is required to initiate a payment/transfer transaction:**

1. Beneficiary Name
2. Beneficiary IBAN (International Bank Account Number) ‚Äî this number can be obtained through a debit card, as it is always attached to a bank account
3. Transfer Amount
4. Transaction Reference (140 characters max.)
5. Currency (EUR)

**The PISP has to send the payer and the beneficiary the following information, immediately after initiating a transaction:**

* Confirmation that the initiation of the transfer with the PSP that manages the payer's account was successful;
* Transaction Unique Identifier (a long number that enables identifying the transaction in the future);
* Transfer amount and currency (EUR);
* PISP Fees (if any);
* Transaction date.

</p>
<br></br>

SIBS carried out a study with the goal of understanding how the Portuguese use different payment methods, find out which ones are the most common and how they are used by consumers with different profiles and in different environments. With this analysis, SIBS also tried to identify trends in the adoption of new and emerging payment methods, as well as any barriers to its adoption.

The market study shows that most Portuguese internet users prefer making purchases with electronic payment methods, both online and in physical stores. The same holds true when making payments to friends and family or paying invoices.

<br></br>
<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FilipaGo/payup-app-prototype/master/_images_readme/sibs_mk-report_payment-factors.jpg" width="1000" />
</p>
<br></br>

In this report, SIBS anticipates a rapid migration from cash to electronic payments, as consumers become more and more familiar with the technology and because people mostly value convenience and speed when choosing a payment method for P2P transactions.

<br></br>
<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FilipaGo/payup-app-prototype/master/_images_readme/sibs_mk-report_payment-method-amount.jpg" width="1000" />
</p>
<br></br>

Cash is still the most used payment method when paying for small amounts.

As PayUp facilitates making payments to family and friends, allowing the user to make an instant interbank transfer to a mobile phone number (no need for IBAN), its simplicity and speed can make it a very convenient alternative to cash, even for smaller payments.

Payments of small amounts among friends are an important opportunity to capture new electronic transactions.

### Benchmarking

<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FilipaGo/payup-app-prototype/master/_images_readme/benchmarking-products.jpg" width="650" />
</p>
<br></br>

We analyzed **16 products** that allow sending transfers/payments to contacts, request the payment of a debt and/or organize joint expenses, using a mobile phone number and/or an email.

**Our goals were:**

* Knowing the scope of the competing products on the market;
* Analyzing their primary features and infer which are most common;
* Testing their usability;
* Knowing what financial costs these products have for the users;
* Determining their main revenue sources;
* Understanding PayUp‚Äôs market placement.

**9 out of 16 products are available in Portugal** and of these, 2 are only available in Portugal.

<br></br>
<p align="center">

</p>
<br></br>

The Benchmarking analysis allowed us to infer some of **PayUp‚Äôs competitive advantages**.

Most products usually target a single functional area: payments (P2P transfers) or splitting expenses ‚Äî **PayUp targets both**.

6 out of 9 products available in Portugal allow the user to make payments. 3 out of 9 products only allow the user to manage splitting expenses and creating groups or events to add expenses.

Only 2 out of 9 allow the user to request the payment of expenses and share them, albeit to a limited extent.

Some companies' business models point to significant costs for the user in at least some specific circumstances ‚Äî **PayUp aims to reduce these costs to a minimum**.

Transfers made between wallet accounts are always free, however, cash-in transactions for the wallet account may have significant costs for the user.

Transfers made from the bank account associated with the debit card, even if not charged by the product being used, may incur costs for the user, depending on their bank.

In the vast majority of cases, most transfers made from the credit card are charged.

At this stage, all Verse transactions are free of charge and Venmo makes free transfers from the bank account associated with the debit card or from another bank account, stating that it supports the costs that may be charged by the user's bank.

In the vast majority of cases, cash-out operations are free although there are circumstances where immediate cash-out is charged.

The sources of income of these products are quite varied, standing out among them the revenues coming from:

* Advertising;
* Trading commissions charged to merchants and customers;
* Foreign exchange conversions;
* Income from the financial investment of the wallet accounts' balance;
* Premium versions with added features;
* In-app purchases.

Splitwise's business model does not imply the generation of revenue from users. According to the organization, the company's revenues will come in the future from a potential agreement with Paypal to be compensated for the traffic redirected to this company. Splitwise is currently funded by business angels.

A significant number of the apps we checked are geographically limited, some of which operate exclusively in the USA ‚Äî **PayUp's MVP covers the national territory (Portugal), but in a second phase it will expand to Europe and in a third one, it will cover low banking territories**.

<br></br>

PayUp‚Äôs sectoral competitors.
</p>
<br></br>

With the previous assumptions set forth and taking into account that PayUp intends to cover the entire value chain, we identified the following primary sectoral competitors:

**In the area of the division of expenses ‚Äî Splitwise**

This application is partial; it allows the users to split expenses but doesn't let them make payments inside the app. It can be easily supplanted by PayUp if the quality of the implemented functionality is at least equivalent to Splitwises'.

**In the area of payments (P2P Transfers) ‚Äî MB WAY and Verse**

MB Way doesn't allow the user to split expenses or request the payment of a debt. It's most significant strength is its' transfer facilities.

Currently, Verse has a great competitive advantage, as it is completely free of charge, but we already know that this will change in the future.

Caixa Plim is only available to Caixa Geral de Depositos' bank clients...

Value Curves.
</p>
<br></br>

PayUp's great advantage will be the integration of both functional areas, allowing the user to split expenses, settle the bills and pay for them.

Although Venmo could have the potential to be a major competitor, we are not considering it as it operates exclusively in the US market.

### Online Surveys

<br></br>
<p align="center">

Our Google Form (details).
</p>
<br></br>

We used accidental sampling (selection by convenience or opportunity) on our surveys, which is a type of nonprobability sampling that involves the sample being drawn from a part of the population which is close to hand. That is, the sample was selected because it was readily available and convenient.

Our criteria for selecting elements was based on assumptions regarding the population of interest, therefore, we could not make generalizations about the total population from this sample because it wasn‚Äôt representative enough.

But even though the sample wasn‚Äôt fully representative of our segment and didn‚Äôt allow us to draw real conclusions, it did allow us to **generate hypotheses and insights** as well as test the questions to be asked during the interviews.

**We wanted to know**:

* Who are the people who share expenses and what are their habits?
* How much do they usually split?
* On which occasions?
* How frequently?
* With whom?
* How do they keep track of shared expenses?
* How do they pay for their share?
* What pain points are they experiencing?

We managed to get a **sample of 100** people over 4 days, who kindly accepted to help us out.

62% of respondents were female and 38% male. 78% of respondents were aged between 20 and 45 and 70% had a college education.

91% of respondents had a smartphone. The majority felt comfortable using it and 88% also used mobile apps on a regular basis.

61% of respondents share expenses. Of those, 85% use online payments.
</p>
<br></br>

The **key findings** from the online surveys were:

* The majority of respondents who share expenses, are aged between 26 and 35 and have a college education;
* They use smartphones, mobile apps and digital payment methods;
* They mainly share expenses when going to group dinners, paying household bills and when purchasing gifts;
* They mostly share supermarket purchases, gasoline and tolls;
* They usually share expenses with friends and boyfriends/girlfriends;
* Most pay less than ‚Ç¨ 40 for their share;
* They split expenses with a medium to medium-high frequency;
* They mainly use money and bank transfers to pay, but prefer bank transfers;
* Bank transfers are used mainly to pay for rent (higher amounts);
* Convenience and ease are the factors that most influence their choice of payment;
* Splitting bills (who pays for what), the immediacy of payment and forgetfulness are the problems that were most often identified when sharing expenses;
* Most respondents usually register expenses on paper and is satisfied using this method.

### Interviews

We conducted **10 interviews** in order to understand the behaviour of people who frequently share expenses and therefore are potential users of our product.
