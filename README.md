## Project Summary

Project developed with L√≠lia Correia and Marta Casal, under the Postgraduate Diploma in Digital Experience Design, which consisted in designing an interactive or semi-functional prototype of a digital product or service, following a user-centered approach.

We designed PayUp; a mobile app to manage shared expenses, receive and pay debts, without the need to expose banking information. All you need is a mobile phone number.

To tackle this challenge we mapped out the following strategy:

+ Ideation and Problem Definition
  - Elevator Pitch
  - Business Model Canvas
  - Value Proposition Canvas
- Research and Strategy
  - Bibliographical Research
  - Technical Documentation Analysis
  - Benchmarking
  - Online Surveys
  - Interviews with Users
  - Expert Interview
  - Personas
  - User and Job Stories
- Interaction Design
  - Functional Requirements Analysis
  - Information Architecture
  - Content Strategy
  - Wireflows
  - User Feedback Rounds üîÅ
- Visual Design
  - Branding
  - Mockups
  - User Feedback Rounds üîÅ
- Prototyping
  - Product Requirements Document
  - Prototype (MVP)
  - User Feedback Rounds üîÅ
- Presentation
  - Pitch Deck and Live Demo
  - Project Report

Even though all team members were involved in all project phases, we each chose a main user flow to work on. I was responsible for designing the flow to create a group to share expenses and add an expense to that group.

**Create a Group and Add an Expense User Flows:**

- Bot Walk Through version (conversational)
- Power User version (chatbot)

L√≠lia tackled the flow for creating an account for a new user and Marta worked on sending money to a friend (making a payment).

## Context and Challenge (Ideation)

With the increasing digitalization of our society, consumers‚Äô habits and expectations have been rapidly changing. The trend of instant access to goods and services, mainly through mobile phones, has driven the growth of real-time payments, fast (instant) and simple.

> Customers make increasingly use of these online and mobile channels to buy goods and services at anytime and anywhere. These developments contribute to the expectation for a faster (or real-time) finality and/or confirmation of the payment. (EPC Report to the ERPB ‚Äì Euro Retail Payments Board ‚Äì on Instant Payments)

PayUp is a mobile app that allows people to split and keep track of shared expenses, pay and collect debts among friends, easily, swiftly and safely, without the need to expose banking information.

PayUp is readily available, anywhere, all the time, to quickly and effortlessly manage splitting costs without estimates, avoid lack of change, having the right amount, or having to know the recipient‚Äôs banking data to make a payment. All that is needed is a mobile phone number or an email address.

The entry into force in 2018 of the new European Payment Services Directive (PSD2) creates the ideal operating conditions for the development of a product like PayUp, operated by a non-banking Fintech (PISP - Payment Initiation Service Provider).

By promoting the entry of new players in the business, simplifying the processing of digital payments in the European Union, improving its efficiency, reducing the costs of digital payments, forcing banks to make open APIs available and increasing the security of payments with strong customer authentication (2-factor authentication), PSD2 enables this type of system.

## Methodology

We followed a LEAN methodology throughout this project. Our primary focus was always, first and foremost, on the perception of our potential users‚Äô needs, testing the solutions that emerged and constantly iterating to improve the previously encountered solutions‚Äô hypothesis... Iterate until Awesome!

Whenever possible, everything was tested with real users; mostly colleagues, trainers and friends. Their feedback was essential to the evolution of the design.

The development of the project went through 3 major phases:

__1. Research and Strategy__

We wanted to make sure that splitting and managing shared expenses, as well as collecting/sending payments, were real problems of our presumed target audience. We tried to find data that could enlighten us on the business area we were working on and help shape the features and requirements that were necessary for the adoption of our solution.

  * Bibliographical Research
  * Technical Documentation Analysis
  * Benchmarking
  * Online Surveys
  * User Interviews
  * Expert Interview
  * Personas
  * User and Job Stories

__2. Interaction Design__

We defined the user flows of the different personas, the information architecture and the wireframes of the platforms that make up our product (mobile app and landing page).

  * Functional Requirements Analysis
  * Information Architecture
  * Content Strategy
  * Wireflows
  * User Feedback Rounds üîÅ

__3. Visual Design and Prototyping__

We designed all visual aspects concerning the product, from branding to high-fidelity mockups and prototypes.

  * Branding
  * Mockups
  * User Feedback Rounds üîÅ
  * Product Requirements Document
  * Prototypes (MVP)
  * User Feedback Rounds üîÅ

## Research and Strategy

Our research plan was kickstarted by five central questions:

1. What are the most important technical and legal requirements and constraints when developing an instant payment/transfer service?

2. Who are our competitors? What are the market trends?

3. How does our target audience split expenses?

4. Which factors influence them the most when choosing a payment/transfer service?

5. Which pain points are they facing and how can we fix them?

Answering these questions was pivotal to assure we were building a true user centric product that would effectively solve a real problem.

To answer our research questions we used the following research methods:

| #       | Research Questions | Research Methods |
| :-----: | --------- | ---------------- |
| **1** | What are the most important technical and legal requirements and constraints when developing an instant payment/transfer service? | - Bibliographical research;<br/>Technical documentation analysis (Directives, Rulebooks, Regulations);<br/>- Interviews with banking experts. |
| **2** | Who are our competitors? What are the market trends? | - Analysis on previous sector reports / Market research (Ex: SIBS Market Report 2016);<br/>- Benchmarking (researching our direct and indirect competitors in order to analyze its‚Äô strengths, weaknesses and possible improvements). |   
| **3** | How does our target audience split expenses? | - Online surveys;<br/> - Interviews with target users. |    
| **4** | Which factors influence them the most when choosing a payment/transfer service? | - Online surveys;<br/> - Interviews with target users. |    
| **5** | Which pain points are they facing and how can we fix them? | - Online surveys;<br/> - Interviews with target users. |
